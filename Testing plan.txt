1. To start off, launch the application through admin.py

2. We query the database to find matching admin credentials.
username: admin
password: password

3. This should close the login screen and open main.py

4. The next step is to enter information for a book. The ISBN is validated to accept integers only.
(I know typical ISBNs aren't int only just roll with it)

5. If you want to update a book with that ISBN just enter that ISBN with new info. 

6. Add a couple of books.

7. The books will appear in the book list that have been added.

8. For the Remove book part enter a books ISBN to remove it. 

9. Simlarly with adding a book there is validation to check for member id being an integer,
email requiring @email.com, and phone number requiring 11 digits.

10. Add a few members.

11. You may remove a member as well using the Member ID. 

12. You can check members using the member list. 

13. If you want to issue a user a book you need the books ISBN and the Member ID.

14. The same goes for returning a book. 

15. When you click on transactions it shows a list of transactions and their dates, whether 
its borrowing or returning a book. 

16. You may now close the program.
